# MEMORY.md - Persistent Context for Claude Code

## Workflow Tools
- **Cowork (Claude Desktop)** is available for interactive browser-based visual verification. Use Cowork for subjective visual checks ("does this look right?", hover states, animations, glass morphism rendering, full-page scrollthroughs). Use Claude Code + Playwright for automated regression checks ("did this break?").
- **Code review reports**: `MTC-Code-Review-Report.docx` (38 findings) and `MTC-Bug-Hunting-Report.docx` (39 findings) in project root.

## Current Status
- **SMTP/Supabase email signups**: Not started yet. Waiting on club president for SMTP info.

### Cowork Bug-Fix Session (2026-03-01)
12 bugs fixed across 11 files. All verified visually in Chrome with no console errors.

**Landing Page (Next.js):**
- `app/(landing)/page.tsx` — MutationObserver debounced with rAF (was firing hundreds of times during animations)
- `app/(landing)/components/Loader.tsx` — Race condition fix: `triggered` ref guard prevents double-trigger between timeout and onLoad
- `app/(landing)/components/Hero.tsx` — Parallax scroll handler throttled with rAF
- `app/(landing)/components/Schedule.tsx` — AbortController + 8s timeout on booking data fetch

**Dashboard:**
- `app/dashboard/lib/store.tsx` — sendMessage rollback now removes only the failed message instead of restoring a stale snapshot (was overwriting other users' messages)

**API:**
- `app/api/mobile-auth/route.ts` — Timing-safe password comparison using `crypto.timingSafeEqual`

**Mobile PWA (source files — NEED `npm run build:mobile` to bundle):**
- `public/mobile-app/js/auth.js` — 24-hour session expiry check, full logout clears all 10 localStorage keys
- `public/mobile-app/js/interactive.js` — Removed stale hardcoded cache name `mtc-court-v148`
- `public/mobile-app/js/utils.js` — Corrupted localStorage auto-cleanup on parse error
- `public/mobile-app/js/messaging.js` — avatarSVGs guard for undefined reference
- `public/mobile-app/sw.js` — Cache fallback on HTTP errors (try cache before returning error response)

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Run `npm run build:mobile` to bundle the mobile PWA source changes into dist. Then run E2E tests to confirm nothing broke.

**Already in place (no action needed):**
- Double-booking UNIQUE index already exists in `supabase/schema.sql` (line 205-206: `idx_bookings_no_double_booking`)

## Decisions Made
- Double-booking prevention: DB-level partial unique index on `(court_id, date, time) WHERE status = 'confirmed'` — already implemented, no code change needed
- Mobile PWA logout: clears all 10 app localStorage keys (not just `mtc-user`)
